Simple Token Authentication
===========================

Token authentication support has been removed from [Devise][devise] for security reasons. In [this gist](https://gist.github.com/josevalim/fb706b1e933ef01e4fb6), Devise's [José Valim][josevalim] explains how tkoen authentication should be performed in order to remain safe.

This gem packages the content of the gist.
